description: |
  The ADF5610 allows implementation of fractional-N or Integer N
  phase-locked loop (PLL) frequency synthesizers when used
  with an external loop filter and an external reference source.
  The wideband microwave voltage controlled oscillator (VCO)
  design permits frequency operation from 7300 MHz to
  14600 MHz at a single radio frequency (RF) output. A series of
  frequency dividers with a differential frequency output allows
  operation from 57 MHz to 14600 MHz.

      In Legacy Mode, ADF5610 requires the chip select active high.

  clock-scales:
    description:
      The Common Clock Framework max rate is limited by MAX
      of unsigned long. For ADF5610, this is a deficiency.
      If specified, this property allows arbitrary scales.
      The first element in the array should be the multiplier
      and the second element should be the divider.
